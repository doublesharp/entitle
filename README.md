# Doublesharp Entitle

Software licensing, subscriptions and private updates for independent publishers.
Use **Entitle** for short. The application serves the API, seller dashboard,
customer portal and background jobs from one TypeScript deployment.

Sell multiple products with annual plans and site or device allowances. Buyers
receive license keys by email, manage installations and download entitled
releases. WordPress has first-class support alongside Joomla, Electron, Tauri,
Sparkle, JetBrains and generic clients. Expiration limits new downloads and
updates; installed software keeps working.

## Choose how to run it

| | Hosted publisher | Self-hosted publisher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | Sign in at `/seller`, create a workspace and connect Stripe | Run the application with your database, private S3 storage, SMTP and Stripe account |
| Operations | The service operator runs infrastructure and backups | You operate infrastructure, upgrades and backups |
| Charges | Operator-configured subscription and application fee, plus Stripe fees | No Entitle platform subscription or application fee; provider costs apply |
| Buyer payments | Your Stripe account | Your Stripe account |

The hosted origin is configured in [src/site.ts](src/site.ts). Use the address
provided by your operator; the repository itself is not a service availability
or pricing commitment. See [hosted tiers and fees](docs/hosted-pricing.md).

## Start here

1. Follow [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for hosted setup, a local
   fixture or a self-hosted installation.
2. Create a product and annual plan in the seller dashboard.
3. Integrate a client and publish an immutable release.
4. Complete a purchase, activation and normal update before accepting customers.

Local development needs the Node/pnpm versions pinned in the repository, a mail
sink and private S3. The optional source-built S3 fixture also needs its exact
Go version. Local billing fixtures require no payment credentials or live charges.
See [Development](docs/development.md) for tools and storage paths.

## Capabilities

- Server-controlled Stripe Checkout and custom Stripe Elements forms, Billing
  reconciliation and Customer Portal access.
- Tenant isolation, scoped automation keys, transactional seat limits and
  expiring email-link sessions with CSRF protection.
- Private S3-compatible releases, package validation, checksums, withdrawal,
  compatibility metadata and authenticated update feeds.
- Customer recovery, account security, sandbox testing, tax settings and
  encrypted publisher transfers.
- Operational metrics and durable jobs. Hosted Pro adds signed outgoing
  webhooks and advanced download reports.

SQLite is the default; PostgreSQL and MySQL use the same business services.
Redis caching is optional. Production uses the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with
[deployment configuration](deploy/compose.yaml) behind HTTPS.

## Documentation

The [documentation index](docs/README.md) provides guides by task.

| Task | Guide |
| --- | --- |
| Manage products, customers and releases | [Seller guide](docs/seller-guide.md) |
| Add licensing and updates to an application | [Client integration](docs/client-integration.md) and [framework support](docs/platform-support.md) |
| Automate integrations | [API](docs/api.md), [CLI](docs/cli.md) and [webhooks](docs/webhooks.md) |
| Operate a server | [Deployment](docs/deployment.md), [configuration](docs/configuration.md) and [backup](docs/backup.md) |
| Move a publisher or handle privacy requests | [Portability](docs/portability.md) and [operator maintenance](docs/operator-maintenance.md) |
| Develop or investigate a failure | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md), [testing](docs/testing.md) and [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) |

The application also serves a public `/docs` guide. Credentials come from
private environment configuration; never put seller API keys in distributed
clients or browser checkout forms.
